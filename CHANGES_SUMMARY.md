## ⚙️ Environment Variables Required

### Required (Already Configured)
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### New (Optional - for database features)
```env
# AWS S3
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
VITE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket

# MongoDB
VITE_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
VITE_MONGODB_DATABASE=questions_db
VITE_MONGODB_COLLECTION=questions
```

## 🔄 Upload Flow

### Individual Upload
1. User clicks "Push to DB"
2. Check if question already exists → abort if yes
3. Download image from original URL
4. Upload to S3 with hash name → get S3 URL
5. Save to MongoDB with S3 URL → get MongoDB ID
6. Show success message

### If Any Step Fails
1. Delete from MongoDB (if saved)
2. Delete from S3 (if uploaded)
3. Show error message
4. **No orphaned data!**

### Batch Upload
1. User clicks "Push All to DB"
2. Upload each question sequentially
3. Track successful vs failed
4. Show summary: "X successful, Y failed"

## 🗄️ Data Structure

### MongoDB Document
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Question text...",
  "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2"],
  "imageUrl": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/questions/hash.jpg",
  "originalImageUrl": "https://cdn.mathpix.com/...",
  "s3ImageUrl": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/questions/hash.jpg",
  "uploadedAt": ISODate("2025-10-21T...")
}
```

### S3 Structure
```
s3://your-bucket/
└── questions/
    ├── a1b2c3d4e5f6...hash1.jpg
    ├── f6e5d4c3b2a1...hash2.jpg
    └── ...
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Rollback Mechanism
- **MongoDB fails** → S3 image is deleted
- **S3 fails** → Nothing saved to MongoDB
- **Prevents**: Orphaned images in S3, incomplete data in MongoDB

### Duplicate Prevention
- Checks MongoDB before uploading
- Prevents duplicate questions by ID
- Shows warning if question exists

### Hash-based Filenames
- SHA-256 hash of URL + timestamp + random
- Prevents filename collisions
- Organized in `questions/` folder

## ⚠️ Security Warnings

### Development vs Production

**Current Setup (Development)**:
- ✅ Quick to set up
- ✅ No backend needed
- ❌ API keys exposed in browser
- ❌ NOT secure for production

**Production Recommendation**:
1. Create backend API server
2. Move AWS/MongoDB credentials to backend
3. Frontend calls backend API
4. Backend calls S3/MongoDB
5. Add authentication/authorization

See `DB_INTEGRATION.md` for production setup examples.

## 📖 Documentation

### Quick Start
- **QUICKSTART_DB.md** - 10-minute setup guide

### Complete Guide
- **DB_INTEGRATION.md** - Full documentation including:
  - AWS S3 setup instructions
  - MongoDB Atlas setup
  - Security best practices
  - API reference
  - Troubleshooting
  - Customization options

### Main README
- **README.md** - Updated with database features

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit .env file with your credentials
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Setup AWS S3 (Optional)
Follow `QUICKSTART_DB.md` or `DB_INTEGRATION.md`

### 4. Setup MongoDB (Optional)
Follow `QUICKSTART_DB.md` or `DB_INTEGRATION.md`

### 5. Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Test Upload
1. Upload markdown file
2. Click "Push to DB" on any question
3. Check S3 and MongoDB!

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Individual Upload
1. Upload markdown with images
2. Click "Push to DB" on question 1
3. Verify in S3 bucket
4. Verify in MongoDB collection

### Test Rollback
1. Set wrong MongoDB URI
2. Try to upload
3. Verify S3 image is deleted
4. Fix URI and retry

### Test Batch Upload
1. Upload markdown with multiple questions
2. Click "Push All to DB"
3. Watch progress
4. See summary

### Test Duplicate Prevention
1. Upload a question
2. Try uploading same question again
3. See warning: "Question already exists"

## 💡 Tips

- **Without DB setup**: App works normally, just no "Push to DB" button functionality
- **Browser console**: Check for detailed logs of upload process
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier is perfect for testing
- **S3 costs**: Very minimal for images (~$0.023/GB/month)

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Cannot find module '@aws-sdk/client-s3'"
- Run `npm install`

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Already working, ignore if you set it earlier

### "Access Denied" (S3)
- Check IAM user permissions
- Verify bucket name

### "Authentication failed" (MongoDB)
- Check username/password in URI
- URL-encode special characters
