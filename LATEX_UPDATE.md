# LaTeX Math Rendering Update ✏️

Your React app now supports beautiful LaTeX mathematical equation rendering!

## What Changed

✅ Added **KaTeX** library for LaTeX rendering
✅ Created **MathText** component to parse and render LaTeX
✅ Updated **QuestionCard** to use MathText for questions and options
✅ Imported KaTeX CSS styles globally

## New Dependencies Installed

- `katex` (v0.16.9) - LaTeX rendering engine
- `react-katex` (v3.0.1) - React wrapper for KaTeX
- `@types/katex` (v0.16.7) - TypeScript definitions

## How to Use

### Inline Math (single `$`)
```markdown
The formula $E = mc^2$ is Einstein's famous equation.
Calculate $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the given function.
```

### Display Math (double `$$`)
```markdown
$$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
```

### Example Question
```markdown
5. What is the slope of line $AB$?
The relationship is $\frac{t_{A}-180}{100}=\frac{t_{B}}{150}$
(1) $\frac{9}{5}$
(2) $\frac{5}{9}$
(3) $\frac{1}{9}$
(4) $3$
```

## How It Works

1. **MathText Component** (`src/components/MathText.tsx`)
   - Parses text for LaTeX expressions (both `$...$` and `$$...$$`)
   - Uses KaTeX to render math to HTML
   - Handles errors gracefully

2. **QuestionCard Updated** (`src/components/QuestionCard.tsx`)
   - Now uses `<MathText>` instead of plain text
   - Renders both question descriptions and options with LaTeX support

3. **Global Styles** (`src/index.css`)
   - Imports KaTeX CSS for proper math styling

## Restart Your Dev Server

If your dev server is still running, restart it to see the changes:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## Test It Out

Upload your `sample_markdown.md` file again and you'll see:
- ✏️ Mathematical formulas rendered beautifully
- 📐 Fractions, subscripts, superscripts all formatted correctly
- 🎨 Professional LaTeX typography just like in PDFs

## Examples of Supported LaTeX

- Fractions: `$\frac{a}{b}$` → a/b
- Subscripts: `$x_{1}$` → x₁
- Superscripts: `$x^{2}$` → x²
- Greek letters: `$\alpha, \beta, \gamma$` → α, β, γ
- Square roots: `$\sqrt{x}$` → √x
- Integrals: `$\int_{a}^{b}$` → ∫ᵇₐ
- Summations: `$\sum_{i=1}^{n}$` → Σⁿᵢ₌₁
- And much more!

## Notes

- The @tailwind CSS warnings you see are normal - they're PostCSS directives that work at build time
- LaTeX rendering happens client-side for best performance
- Invalid LaTeX will show in red with the raw text as fallback
